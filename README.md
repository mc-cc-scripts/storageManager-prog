# storageManager

WORK IN PROGRESS

A script to push and pull items from storage. This is based on storage drawers and for now will only support one drawer controller connected to multiple storage drawers.

# Setup
![Setup](setup/storageManager.jpg)
- [1] Computer
- [2] Wired Modem (Right-click to make sure everything is connected!)
- [3] Transfer Chest (In- and Output)
- [4] Drawer Controller
- [5] Drawers

**Note:** You may leave space between Computer, Chest and Drawer Controller but you will need an modem next to each of those and have those modems connected via cables.
You may also omit the modems entirely and have the Computer in between the Chest and the Drawer Controller.
